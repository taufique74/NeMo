These scripts are used for extracting features from LJSpeech.

You will need to run the following scripts (note that these will call the other
scripts as necessary):

- `create_manifests_and_textfiles.py`
- `extract_ljspeech_phonemes_and_durs.sh`
  (Calls `create_token2idx_dict.py` and `calculate_durs.py`.)
- `extract_ljspeech_energy.py`
